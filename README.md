# Management-Groups

# Some companies may have multiple subscriptions for their different departments
- Company may have a staging subscription AND a production subscription 
- Admins can divide them in management groups where HR department has 2 different subscription
- And Logistics department have 2 other subscriptions.
- By default, there is one tenant root group and all of the subscriptions will fall into the tenant root group.
- Management group would be the child of the tenant root group
- Permissions assigned at the Management group level will be inherited by the subscriptions within the management group
